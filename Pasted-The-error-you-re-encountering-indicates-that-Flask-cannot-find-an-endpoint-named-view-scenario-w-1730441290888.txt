The error you're encountering indicates that Flask cannot find an endpoint named `'view_scenario'` when trying to build a URL using `url_for('view_scenario')`. Here's the key part of the error message:

```
werkzeug.routing.exceptions.BuildError: Could not build url for endpoint 'view_scenario'. Did you mean 'serve_static' instead?
```

This typically happens when:

1. The endpoint `'view_scenario'` is not defined in your Flask application's routes.
2. The endpoint is defined but under a different name.
3. There's a typo in the `url_for` call or in the route decorator.

### Understanding the Error

- **Location of Error**: The error occurs in your template `base.html` on line 44:

  ```html
  <a class="nav-link" href="{{ url_for('view_scenario') }}">Scenarios</a>
  ```

- **During Error Handling**: Notably, this error happens while rendering the `500.html` error page, which extends `base.html`. This suggests that the error page itself is causing an error due to the missing endpoint.

### Steps to Resolve the Error

#### 1. Verify Endpoint Definition

Check your Flask routes to ensure that the `'view_scenario'` endpoint is defined. In your `routes.py` or equivalent file, you should have something like:

```python
@app.route('/scenario', endpoint='view_scenario')
def view_scenario():
    # Your code here
```

**OR**

If you're using the function name as the endpoint (default behavior), ensure the function is named `view_scenario`:

```python
@app.route('/scenario')
def view_scenario():
    # Your code here
```

In this case, the endpoint is automatically set to the function name, `view_scenario`.

#### 2. Check for Typos

Ensure there are no typos in either the route definitions or the `url_for` call:

- **In `base.html`**:

  ```html
  <a class="nav-link" href="{{ url_for('view_scenario') }}">Scenarios</a>
  ```

- **In your route**:

  ```python
  @app.route('/scenario')
  def view_scenario():
      # Function code
  ```

#### 3. Adjust the Endpoint Name

If the function or endpoint is named differently, update either the route or the template:

- **Option A**: Rename the function to match the endpoint in the template.

  ```python
  @app.route('/scenario')
  def view_scenario():
      # Function code
  ```

- **Option B**: Change the `url_for` call in the template to match the actual endpoint.

  If your function is named `serve_scenario`, update the template:

  ```html
  <a class="nav-link" href="{{ url_for('serve_scenario') }}">Scenarios</a>
  ```

#### 4. Verify Route Registration

Ensure that the route is registered before the error handler and the rendering of the template:

- Flask needs to know about all routes before it can build URLs for them.
- If routes are conditionally registered or imported in a way that they might not be available at the time of template rendering, adjust the import order.

#### 5. Avoid Complex Templates in Error Pages

Since the error occurs while rendering the `500.html` error page, which extends `base.html`, consider simplifying the error templates to avoid further exceptions during error handling:

- **Create a Minimal `500.html` Template**:

  ```html
  <!doctype html>
  <title>Server Error</title>
  <h1>500 - Internal Server Error</h1>
  <p>Sorry, an unexpected error occurred.</p>
  ```

- **Avoid Extending `base.html` in Error Templates**:

  Error pages should be as simple as possible to prevent additional errors during their rendering.

#### 6. Check for Circular Errors

It's possible that the original error that led to the `500.html` being rendered is related to the missing endpoint. By fixing the missing endpoint, you might resolve both the original error and the error in the error handler.

### Example Correction

Assuming the function is actually named `serve_scenario`, you can:

- **Update the Template**:

  ```html
  <a class="nav-link" href="{{ url_for('serve_scenario') }}">Scenarios</a>
  ```

- **Or Update the Route**:

  ```python
  @app.route('/scenario')
  def view_scenario():
      # Function code
  ```

### Additional Debugging Steps

- **List All Routes**: You can print out all the registered routes to verify which endpoints are available:

  ```python
  for rule in app.url_map.iter_rules():
      print(f"Endpoint: {rule.endpoint}, URL: {rule}")
  ```

- **Check the Endpoint Names**: Ensure that the endpoint names match what you are using in `url_for`.

### Conclusion

The error indicates a mismatch between the endpoint name used in your template and the actual endpoints defined in your Flask app. By ensuring that the endpoint `'view_scenario'` exists and matches the name used in `url_for`, you should be able to resolve the `BuildError`.

If you continue to experience issues, consider simplifying your error templates and double-checking all route definitions for consistency.
